# Encapsulation-vs-Abstraction

Differences between Encapsulation vs Abstraction.

 # Encapsulation
 
Encapsulation is the packing of "data" and "functions operating on that data" into a single component and restricting the access to some of the object's components.
Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition.

# Abstraction

Abstraction is a mechanism which represent the essential features without including implementation details.

# Key Difference

Encapsulation is Information hiding.

Abstraction is Implementation hiding.


# Other Differences

Abstraction VS Encapsulation

1.	Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information.	While encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.

2.	In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.	While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.

3.	Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information.	Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside.

4.	We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.	Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, protected and public.

5.	In abstraction, implementation complexities are hidden using abstract classes and interfaces.	While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.

6.	The objects that help to perform abstraction are encapsulated.	Whereas the objects that result in encapsulation need not be abstracted.
